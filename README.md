# Vii: A Vi-like Text Editor
Vii is an upcoming terminal-based text editor inspired by the classic vi editor. This project aims to provide a lightweight, fast, and keyboard-driven editing experience with modern enhancements. The goal is to build a fully functional text editor that supports essential editing features and can be customized for a variety of workflows.

Note: This project is currently in the early planning and development phase.

## Project Vision
The goal of Vii is to provide a minimalist yet powerful text editor that mimics the core behavior of vi while adding modern enhancements such as better cross-platform compatibility, a more intuitive configuration system, and support for popular programming languages.

## Planned Features
Vi-like Keybindings: Emulate vi's Normal, Insert, and Command modes, allowing efficient keyboard navigation and editing.
Syntax Highlighting: Support for syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
Customizable Configuration: Easily change keybindings, themes, and other settings.
Multi-file Support: Open and edit multiple files at once (tabbed or split view).
Search & Replace: Implement an efficient search and replace mechanism.
Undo/Redo: Keep track of changes with undo and redo functionality.
Cross-platform Support: The editor will work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
A terminal or command-line environment.
A system with a C compiler (e.g., GCC for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows) and make utility.
## Installation (Coming Soon)
The installation instructions will be provided once the project is in a more mature state. Initially, users will likely be able to build the editor from source or install it via package managers once development is further along.

## Usage (Coming Soon)
The basic usage will involve starting the editor with a file:

``` vii <filename> ``` <br>

You will be able to navigate and edit your file using vi-style keybindings (e.g., i for Insert mode, Esc for Normal mode).

## Configuration (Planned)
Once implemented, Vii will allow users to adjust settings like keybindings, color schemes, and other preferences via a simple, human-readable configuration file.

## Development Status
This project is currently in the planning phase. The core features, such as vi-like keybindings and basic file handling, are yet to be implemented.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Core features (basic editing, modes, keybindings).
### Phase 2: File management, undo/redo, syntax highlighting.
### Phase 3: Configuration options, multi-file support, and more advanced features.
### Phase 4: Optimization, bug fixes, and cross-platform support.
